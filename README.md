## Deployment
The task is already deployed to Vecel, be free to access them as follows:

- Wine API GET endpoint: https://wine-carousel.vercel.app/api/wine
- Product Carousel app: https://wine-carousel.vercel.app/ 


## Getting Started with local build
Recommanded node version > 20

Firstly install like all other projects:
```bash
npm
```


Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the product carousel.

Please update the system variable WINE_API_URL in the .env file if the port number is not 3000.

Furthermore, all tests can be run with:
```bash
npm run test
```

## Assumptions

### To address the conflicts sitting on the task itself

1. The images that are required in instructions.md were not provided, therefore I made the assumption to use the image placeholder in data.json file.
2. There was slight data inconsistency in data.json file like image vs imageSrc, hence I unify them to imageSrc.

### Technical Assumptions
1. The mockup image and data.json indicate all the possible use cases that the carousel will display, as a Qantas Point user I do know there are many use cases however as of now they are deemed to be out of scope.
2. Wine data is not very time-sensitive data, so that it is allowed to be cached in a short while to potentially reduce server stress.
3. I assume there will be keyboard users and screen reader users to access the carousel.
4. What I am going to demonstrate is more than a carousel. What have been covered in the submission includes:
    - Wine API GET endpoint with data.json behind the scenes
    - Wine API data cache only revalidates itself in every hour
    - A11y enhancements so that the cohorts who have to leverage screen readers can easily understand the information about discounted price
    - Server component first to potentially boost loading experience, caching efficiency, SEO and data security
    - Image caching therefore you should see all the product placeholder images are identical because of it


## Development A to Z

### Tech stacks
 - Next.js 15 + create-next-app
 - React, tailwindcss
 - jest, jest-dom, react-testing-library, next-test-api-route-handler
 - react-slick

### Usage of Cursor AI
Admittedly, Cursor AI was used to generate type file from the data.json and calibrate the styles.

### Commit history rundown
 1. feat: the initial commit creating the next app - *Commit all files generated by create-next-app*
 2. chore: install the setup jest and RTL - *Commit all testing frameworks*
 3. feat: TDD and create the wine GET REST endpoint - *Handcraft the API by TDD*
 4. feat: TDD wine card html skeleton - *A11y driven wine card component with TDD, aria-label and archor tag are in place for keyboards and screen readers*
 5. feat: style the wine card, save progress - *Styling with tailwind*
 6. feat: completed styling - *Styling with tailwind*
 7. feat: connect wine cards with the wine API - *Call wine API on server side and cache it for one hour*
 8. feat: implement react slick carousel - *Server renders the wine card, client renders the react-slick carousel*
 9. fix: format the points as per design - *cross check the design and fix bug*

## Limitations and Trade-offs
Given the task is designed for 4 - 5 hours, there are a couple of points that I have to de-prioritise or trade-off:
1. The playwright E2E test to test the carousel works as expected at deployed environment for different browsers 
2. The robusted error handling and suspense optimization in page.tsx
3. Use styled component instead of tailwind for ui components to load styles as demand
4. UI responsiveness is in place however not very well polished to be pixel perfect
5. Access Next.js Route handler with a Next.js Server component is an anti-pattern however it's low-hanging fruit for a code test
